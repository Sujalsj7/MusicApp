### Micro Frontend & Role-based Auth

**Micro Frontend Architecture**

The app is split into two parts:

- **Main App**: Container application that hosts the micro frontend.  
- **Music Library**: Exposed as a module using Module Federation.

**Integration**

- The main app imports the Music Library dynamically via `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.  
- The main app does not need the internal code of Music Libraryâ€”only the exposed module.

**Role-based Authentication**

- Uses in-memory JWT-like tokens (no backend required).

**Roles & Permissions**

- **Admin**:  
  - Can add new songs via modal.  
  - Can delete songs.

- **User**:  
  - Can only view and filter songs.

- UI elements dynamically show or hide based on the user role.
